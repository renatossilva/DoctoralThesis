Renato's Doctoral Thesis PESC/COPPE/UFRJ
These codes refer to the machine learning model proposed in my Doctoral Thesis to infer about the BGP update messages belief mass.
The goal is to create a reputation system in order to prevent internal attacks from remote malicious autonomous systems.
Altough there are a lot of public BGP datasets for training machine learning models, the most of them have volumetric attributes, which does not match with the goals of the distributed detection system.
